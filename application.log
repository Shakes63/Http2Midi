There are 4 different commands that you can send to this web server. 
There is MIDI Note On, MIDI Note Off, MIDI CC Message, and List MIDI Devices. 

In order to sent a Note On you will need to provide these parameters to /midi/noteon:
deviceName: Name of the device you are wanting to send the message to in a string format exactly like you see when running the list devices command.
channel: Number from 0 - 15 indicating the channel number you want to connect to.
note: Number from 0 - 128 corresponding to the different midi notes.
velocity: Number from 0 - 128 indicating the velocity.
Example: http://localhost:8080/midi/noteon?deviceName=Propresenter&channel=0&note=52&velocity=128

In order to sent a Note Off you will need to provide these parameters to /midi/noteoff:
deviceName: Name of the device you are wanting to send the message to in a string format exactly like you see when running the list devices command.
channel: Number from 0 - 15 indicating the channel number you want to connect to.
note: Number from 0 - 128 corresponding to the different midi notes.
Example: http://localhost:8080/midi/noteoff?deviceName=Propresenter&channel=0&note=52

In order to sent a CC Message you will need to provide these parameters to /midi/cc:
deviceName: Name of the device you are wanting to send the message to in a string format exactly like you see when running the list devices command.
channel: Number from 0 - 15 indicating the channel number you want to connect to.

There are 4 different commands that you can send to this web server. 
There is MIDI Note On, MIDI Note Off, MIDI CC Message, and List MIDI Devices. 

In order to sent a Note On you will need to provide these parameters to /midi/noteon:
deviceName: Name of the device you are wanting to send the message to in a string format exactly like you see when running the list devices command.
channel: Number from 0 - 15 indicating the channel number you want to connect to.
note: Number from 0 - 128 corresponding to the different midi notes.
velocity: Number from 0 - 128 indicating the velocity.
Example: http://localhost:8080/midi/noteon?deviceName=Propresenter&channel=0&note=52&velocity=128

In order to sent a Note Off you will need to provide these parameters to /midi/noteoff:
deviceName: Name of the device you are wanting to send the message to in a string format exactly like you see when running the list devices command.
channel: Number from 0 - 15 indicating the channel number you want to connect to.
note: Number from 0 - 128 corresponding to the different midi notes.
Example: http://localhost:8080/midi/noteoff?deviceName=Propresenter&channel=0&note=52

In order to sent a CC Message you will need to provide these parameters to /midi/cc:
deviceName: Name of the device you are wanting to send the message to in a string format exactly like you see when running the list devices command.
channel: Number from 0 - 15 indicating the channel number you want to connect to.
ccNumber: Number from 0 - 128 corresponding to the different midi notes.
value: Number from 0 - 128 corresponding to the different midi notes.
Example: http://localhost:8080/midi/cc?deviceName=Propresenter&channel=0&ccNumber=15&value=33

In order to list out the available midi devices you will need to send a request to /midi/list
Example: http://localhost:8080/midi/list
